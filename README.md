# Put some Stache in your Bootstrap Wordpress Stack.

StacheStack is a fork of the amazing [Roots](http://roots.io) theme, so we can code less and comb our staches more.
There are a lot of added hooks, actions, and rewrites to make it completely extensible.
Using the included *Tinker Tailor* (admin panel) and [*Visual Composer*](http://vc.wpbakery.com), website developers and site owners can create and prototype sites without any coding.
And, developers can peel it apart and use this century's coding practices (unlike most theme stacks which are still using pomade to style their mustaches).

## Tinker Tailor
`Because it's nice to have your own tailor. `

You'll be keen to know that we decided to make this easy for website owners to use, first and foremost. Second forth, we wanted to use something open and well documented that developers could easily extend.
Hence, we have included a heavily customized version of the handy [ReduxFramework](http://reduxframework.com) to manage a sweet suite of out-of-the-box options, that can easily be customized and extended by the finest of tinkering tailors.


## Feathers & Bowties (Features)
So, we like a good snifter of fine craft beer (and the occasional pint). It's a hobby. To actually get time to do your hobby, you have to [GYSHIDO](http://gyshido.com). To [GYSHIDO](http://gyshido.com) with code, you need to work smarter.
So you can work smarter and drink more crafties, StacheStack uses tools like...
* [Grunt](http://roots.io/using-grunt-for-wordpress-theme-development/) for compiling LESS to CSS, checking for JS errors, live reloading, concatenating and minifying files, versioning assets, and generating lean Modernizr builds
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) for front-end package management
* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
  * The latest [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) via Google CDN, with a local fallback
  * The latest [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) build for feature detection, with lean builds with Grunt
  * An optimized Google Analytics snippet
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* Organized file and template structure
* ARIA roles and microformats
* [Theme activation](http://roots.io/roots-101/#theme-activation)
* [Theme wrapper](http://roots.io/an-introduction-to-the-roots-theme-wrapper/)
* Cleaner HTML output of navigation menus
* Posts use the [hNews](http://microformats.org/wiki/hnews) microformat
* [Multilingual ready](http://roots.io/wpml/) and over 30 available [community translations](https://github.com/roots/roots-translations)
